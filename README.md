# osu-Scraper-Tool
A simple command line code which gets players top plays and puts them into csv file

Please don't open the csv file while the code is running otherwise it will crash the code due to permission errors.
Make sure that you can connect to osu website before running otherwise the code won't work i.e at school where the website is blocked.

I'm attempting to get a GUI made up with tkinter but it's a pain in the ass so that may take some time.
